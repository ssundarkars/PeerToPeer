Note:- All the coding has been done on the Linux platform, there might be some platform dependencies, if being used in other platforms, you need to handle them seperately. Please try to resolve them, and feel free to contact me for help/suggestions.


Welcome to Peer to Peer, a secure and confidential connecting platform. To facilitate a successful connection with your peer, kindly follow these straightforward steps:

**Connecting to Your Peer: A Step-by-Step Guide**

**Prerequisites:**
1. Ensure that both clients/machines/peers possess a file named "Peer2Peer.py".
2. Verify that both machines are equipped with Python version 3.8.0 or above to enable the execution of the provided module/s.
3. The compiler environment must have the following packages installed:
    1. time
    2. tkinter (Tk)
    3. socket
    4. threading

**Connection Instructions:**
The application necessitates the IPv4 address, in conjunction with the port address, of the intended machine for the establishment of communication between peers. Either of the two machines can function as the server while the other assumes the role of the client. 

Ex: addresswithport=['127.23.45.123',45554]

It is recommended to select a port within the preferred range of 1000 to 65535.

By adhering to these guidelines, you will be able to establish a successful connection between peers and engage in seamless communication through the Peer to Peer platform.

Thank you for choosing our platform for your connecting needs. Should you encounter any issues or require further assistance, please reach out for any Instructions.
